**Effective date:** {September 20, 2025}  
**Owner:** **Ali Fayed** (“we”, “us”, “our”)  
**App:** **Lftly** (the “App”)

We respect your privacy. This policy explains what we collect, why we collect it, and how you can control your data.

---

## 1) Information We Collect
- **Account info**: email address and user ID when you sign up or sign in.  
- **Content you provide**: workout videos you upload, titles, notes, and related metadata (e.g., width/height).  
- **Purchase info**: subscription status and entitlement details received from Apple and our billing provider (no full payment card data).  
- **App & device data**: basic diagnostics (app version, device model, OS version), crash logs, and performance events.  
- **Support communications**: messages you send to our support channels.

## 2) How We Use Information
- Provide core features (video analysis, captions, and saved workouts).  
- Manage accounts, subscriptions, and access to “pro” features.  
- Improve reliability, safety, and performance.  
- Communicate important updates, feature changes, or policy notices.  
- Prevent abuse, fraud, and misuse.

## 3) Processing of Videos
- Videos you upload are processed to generate form analysis and overlays.  
- Processed outputs are stored so you can view, share, or re-download them.  
- You may delete your videos at any time (see **Your Choices**).

## 4) Payments & Subscriptions
- **Apple In-App Purchase** handles payment authorization. We do **not** receive your full card details.  
- We use **RevenueCat** to securely manage entitlements and subscription status.

## 5) Service Providers (Data “Processors”)
We use trusted providers to run the App, for example:
- **Supabase** (authentication, database, storage)  
- **RevenueCat** (subscription management)  
- **Apple** (App Store and in-app purchases)  
These providers process data on our behalf under contractual safeguards.

## 6) Data Sharing
We do **not** sell your personal data.  
We share data only with:
- Service providers listed above (to operate the App).  
- Authorities if required by law or to protect rights, safety, or security.  
- A successor entity in case of merger, acquisition, or restructuring (with equivalent protections).

## 7) Data Retention
- Account and subscription records: retained while your account is active and as needed for legal/operational purposes.  
- Videos and generated outputs: retained until you delete them or your account, subject to backups and legal holds.  
- Diagnostics and logs: retained for a limited time to ensure reliability and security.

## 8) Security
We use technical and organizational measures to protect your information. No system is perfectly secure; please use a strong, unique password and keep your device up to date.

## 9) Children’s Privacy
Lftly is not directed to children under 9 (or the minimum age required in your region). We do not knowingly collect data from children in that age group.

## 10) Your Choices & Rights
- **Access / update** your info: in-app where available or contact us.  
- **Delete videos**: remove any video you’ve uploaded.  
- **Delete account**: contact us to request account deletion.  
- **Marketing**: we currently do not use in-app marketing subscriptions; if we do, you’ll have opt-out controls.  
- **EEA/UK/Swiss users**: you may have rights to access, rectify, erase, restrict, port, or object to processing.  
- **California residents**: you may have rights under the CCPA/CPRA, including to know, delete, and correct certain information.

## 11) International Transfers
If we transfer data outside your region, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) where required.
